# 💤 Sleep Health and Digital Screen Exposure Risk Prediction

A comprehensive data science project that investigates the impact of digital screen exposure on sleep health. The project combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical visualizations, and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and predict sleep quality based on screen time and other lifestyle factors.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Explore the relationship between screen time and sleep quality.
- Visualize key correlations and trends in the dataset.
- Build machine learning models to predict sleep disruption.
- Offer actionable insights for improving digital wellness.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Approach

- **Preprocessing**: Feature scaling, handling missing values, label encoding.
- **Models Tried**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Target Variable**: Sleep quality level (binary or multi-class)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC

## 🚀 Future Work

- Incorporate more advanced deep learning models (LSTM, CNN)
- Add mobile vs desktop screen usage segmentation
- Collect time-series data for sequential modeling
- Build an interactive dashboard using Plotly/Dash or Power BI
